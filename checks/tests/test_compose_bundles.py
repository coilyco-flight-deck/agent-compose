"""Cover the bundle composition the release build runs and `just test` did not.

`scripts/compose-bundles.py` is invoked only by `just compose-bundles` and by
`scripts/release-build.sh`, so nothing in the validation gate ever ran it. On
2026-09-08 that gap shipped twice: v2.105.0 and v2.106.0 both passed `just test`,
tagged, and then died in `release-build` with

    ValueError: role 'analyst' is archived and cannot be composed

The tags exist and the releases do not, so every host is still on v2.104.0 and
the rename cannot reach one. A validation step that does not run what the build
runs is the defect, not the archived role.
